## Project future
I just want to point out that this may be a different app that i crate for the final project, that i am not 100% sure which direction i want to go. Hence why there isn't much features that have been made.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the project **locally**.

### 1. How to use it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdiox/app-project1.git
cd app-project1/frontend

npm install

npm run dev
